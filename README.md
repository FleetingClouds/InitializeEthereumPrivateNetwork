# InitializeEthereumPrivateNetwork

Start a basic Ethereum private network in minutes!

A set of scripts for initializing an Ethereum private network for testing and development.

### Prerequisites

These scripts were developed for two freshly created Xubuntu 16.04LTS virtual machines running in Qemu/KVM.

They should work without problem in all recent Debian based VMs in any hypervisor, but this has not been tested.
